# ExoExplorer - Project Details (Submission Format)

## What It Does & How It Works

ExoExplorer is a comprehensive dual-purpose platform bridging scientific research with public education through immersive 3D visualization and cutting-edge machine learning.

**Core Components:**

**1. Interactive 3D Exoplanet Encyclopedia:** We transform NASA's entire database of 7,762 confirmed exoplanets into an immersive 3D experience. Users navigate through space, exploring planets at their actual celestial coordinates with dynamically generated textures based on physical properties (temperature, radius, mass, atmospheric composition). Built with Three.js and Cesium 3D Tiles, featuring LOD optimization, procedural texture generation, and natural language search powered by OpenAI embeddings.

**2. AI-Powered Discovery Tool:** Our deep neural network (PyTorch, 98-99% accuracy, ROC-AUC >0.99) automates exoplanet identification from mission data—addressing NASA's challenge directly. Trained on ~10,000 Kepler Objects of Interest, our model features strategic class weighting to minimize Type II errors (missed planets), because in exoplanet research, missing a discovery is more costly than investigating a false positive. The production-ready FastAPI server provides real-time inference with explainable AI insights via GPT-4 integration.

**3. Seamless Integration:** Scientists upload CSV files or manually input transit photometry data (19+ parameters) for instant classification. Educators and students explore through natural language queries ("Show me hot Jupiters"), click planets for detailed information, and save favorites—all with zero barriers (no login required for exploration).

## Benefits & Impact

**Scientific Benefits:**
- **Accelerating Discovery:** Process thousands of candidates in seconds vs. years of manual analysis. With TESS actively collecting data and K2 archives incomplete, we can uncover hundreds of hidden planets in existing datasets.
- **Reducing Human Bias:** Consistent, objective classification free from fatigue or cognitive bias.
- **Democratizing Research:** Enable citizen scientists, small institutions without ML infrastructure, and international collaboration without barriers.

**Educational Benefits:**
- **Visceral Understanding:** Navigating 3D space to find Kepler-442b among thousands creates lasting comprehension vs. reading abstract distances.
- **Multi-Level Pathways:** Elementary (visual exploration) → High School (scientific parameters) → Undergraduate (ML principles) → Graduate (model architecture).
- **STEM Inspiration:** Making humanity's quest to answer "Are we alone?" accessible and beautiful inspires future space scientists.

**Societal Impact:**
- **Universal Accessibility:** Browser-based, no installation, works on smartphones to 4K displays, deployable in resource-limited environments.
- **Museum-Ready:** Visual sophistication ideal for science centers, planetariums, classrooms, libraries, and public outreach.
- **Expanding Scientific Literacy:** Bridge raw NASA data to public understanding, helping citizens appreciate astronomical surveys and ML applications.

## Technical Excellence

**Stack & Architecture:**

- Frustum culling and visibility optimization
- Procedural texture generation (Perlin noise + physical parameters)
- Strategic batch processing and async operations

## Creativity & Innovation

**Novel Paradigm:** Most exoplanet databases are spreadsheets. We reimagined everything:
- **Instead of:** Searching tables → **We offer:** Flying through 3D space with natural language
- **Instead of:** Abstract numbers → **We provide:** Intuitive visual textures (lava worlds vs ice giants)
- **Instead of:** Manual classification → **We enable:** Real-time ML with explainable AI

**Technical Innovation:**
1. **Hybrid Architecture:** First platform combining complete catalog (7,762 planets) + 3D spatial visualization + AI discovery + natural language search + educational accessibility + research utility
2. **Scientifically-Inspired Procedural Textures:** Creating compelling planet appearances from just mass, radius, temperature
3. **Semantic Astronomy Search:** Vector embeddings for queries like "hot Jupiters near Earth"
4. **Class-Weighted Learning:** Explicitly optimizing for scientific priorities (catching planets > avoiding false positives)
5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Immediate 3D exploration enriched with AI, database, favorites—graceful feature addition

**UX Innovation:**
- Right-click navigation (preserves UI interaction)
- "Return to Earth" button (spatial context)
- Glassmorphic floating UI
- Real-time confidence visualization

## Design Decisions & Rationale

**Technology Choices:**
- **Next.js:** SSR for SEO, API routes for backend, component reusability, hot reloading
- **Three.js:** Industry standard, excellent performance, extensive documentation, WebGL control
- **PyTorch:** Pythonic syntax, dynamic graphs for experimentation, strong research community
- **MongoDB:** Flexible schema for evolving exoplanet data, JSON handling, horizontal scaling

**Model Decisions:**
- **3-Layer Architecture:** Testing showed diminishing returns beyond 3 layers for tabular data; simpler trains faster with less overfitting
- **1.5:1 Class Weighting:** Catches ~95% candidates while keeping false positives acceptable; domain experts prefer follow-up over missed discoveries
- **Batch Size 64:** Sweet spot for stability and convergence speed

**UX Decisions:**
- **No Forced Login:** Lower barrier = wider impact; students exploring shouldn't need accounts
- **3D Navigation:** Spatial relationships matter in astronomy; clusters become visible; creates memorable experience
- **AI Explanations:** Black-box ML doesn't educate; transparency critical for scientific trust

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. Performance with 7,762+ objects (LOD, culling, optimization → 60 FPS)
2. 30-50% missing values in NASA data (sophisticated imputation)
3. Imbalanced classes (class weighting + stratified sampling)
4. Visually distinct textures from limited parameters (Perlin noise algorithms)
5. Natural language astronomy search (embedding-based semantic matching)
